* **Ignore Constant Values or take it as 1**<br/>
* **If a value will be taken from input, like from n. It's linear.**<br/>
* **When there will 2 n/input loops be present.Then it's quadratic. Ex: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z34vv48ts2g&t=2146s)**<br/>

* **In Logarithmic Time Complexity Log base is 2. Because Binary, everything in Computer Science is 1 & 0. Ex: T(n) -> O(log2 n) | [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z34vv48ts2g&t=2439s)**<br/>
* **Exponential**

### Time Complexity 

    Time complexity is the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input.

### Space Complexity

    Space complexity is the amount of memory used by the algorithm to execute.

### Asymptotic Notations

    Asymptotic notation describes the algorithm's efficiency and performance in a meaningful way.
    Types of Asymptotic notations:-
        1.Big O (O):-
            Used to denote Worst case complexity.
        2.Big Omega (Ω):-
            Used to denote best-case complexity.
        3.Theta (Θ):-
            Used to denote average-case complexity.

### Various Time Complexities

   * Constant Time Complexity:-  O(1)
   * Linear Time Complexity:- O(n)
   * Quadratic Time Complexity:- O(n^2)
   * Logarithmic Time Complexity:- O(log base2 n)
   * Exponential Time Complexity:- O(2^n)
