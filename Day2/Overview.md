# Complexity in Algorithm

**1. Time Complexity ( Most Needed)**<br/>
**2. Space Complexity (Less important now-a-days)**

## TIME COMPLEXITY

### Asymptotic Notations (5)

#### 1.Big O (Worst case scenario)
#### 2.Big Omega (Best case scenario)
#### 3.Theta (Average case scenario)

***====== For Research ======***

#### 4. Small O
#### 5. Small Omega

**================================================**

### Various Time Complexity

* Constant | O(1)/O(c)
* Linear | O(n)
* Quadratic | O(n^2)
* Cubic | O(n^3)
* Logarithmic | O(log base2 n)
* Exponential | O(2^n)

**================================================**

**Ignore Constant Values or take it as 1**<br/>
**If a value will be taken from input, like from n. It's linear.**<br/>
**When there will 2 n/input loops be present.Then it's quadratic.Ex: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z34vv48ts2g&t=2146s**<br/>

**In Logarithmic Time Complexity Log base is 2. Because Binary, everything in Computer Science is 1 & 0. Ex: T(n) -> O(log2 n)**

# Provided as summary in post

### Time Complexity 

    Time complexity is the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input.

### Space Complexity

    Space complexity is the amount of memory used by the algorithm to execute.

### Asymptotic Notations

    Asymptotic notation describes the algorithm's efficiency and performance in a meaningful way.
    Types of Asymptotic notations:-
        Big O (O):-
            Used to denote Worst case complexity.
        Big Omega (Ω):-
            Used to denote best-case complexity.
        Theta (Θ):-
            Used to denote average-case complexity.

### Various Time Complexities

   * Constant Time Complexity:-  O(1)
   * Linear Time Complexity:- O(n)
   * Quadratic Time Complexity:- O(n^2)
   * Logarithmic Time Complexity:- O(log base2 n)
   * Exponential Time Complexity:- O(2^n)
