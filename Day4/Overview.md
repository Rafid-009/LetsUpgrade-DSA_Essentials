# How Uber is using searching Algorithm for Cab Finding 

### Searching Alogorithm
* **Linear Search Algorithm -> O(n)**

Works on **unsorted list/array**. Searches one by one from first element.

* **Binary Search Algorithm ->  O(log n)**

Works on **sorted (ascending order) list/array**. Searches by dividing into half and comparing it should go left or right. Ex: n/2 -> n/4.

### **Linear Search Algorithm**

   * Linear search is the simplest searching algorithm that searches for an element in a list in sequential order. 
   * We simply traverse the list completely and match each element of the list with the item whose location is to be found.
   * If the match is found then the location of the item is returned otherwise the algorithm returns NULL.
   * Linear search is mostly used for unordered elements.
   * The Time complexity of the linear search is O(n).

### **Binary Search Algorithm** 

   * Binary search is a fast search algorithm that works on the principle of divide and conquers.
   * Binary search works only on a sorted set of elements.
   * Binary search looks for a particular item by comparing the middlemost item of the collection. If a match occurs, then the index of the item is returned. 
   * If the middle item is greater than the item, then the item is searched in the sub-list to the left of the middle item. Otherwise, the item is searched for in the sub-list to the right of the middle item. 
   * This process continues on the sub-list as well until the size of the sub-list reduces to zero.
   * The Time Complexity of the binary search is O(log n).
